    >"A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a "system" Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system."

- Why should you use them?
    - If need different versions of same package for different projects
    - If working on managed servers or production environments where can't modify system-wide packages because they have specific package version requirements
- Python's `venv` module
- Anaconda
